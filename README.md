# Another Command Prompt

Another Command Prompt (aCmd) is an emulation of the Windows Command Prompt written entirely in batch.

It is intended to be a full-featured command prompt alternative to be used when the default Windows Command Prompt is blocked by an administrator, as it is on many restricted computers at schools and workplaces.
